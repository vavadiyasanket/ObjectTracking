# Object Tracking
### Object tracking is the process of:
1. Taking an initial set of object detections  
2. Creating a unique ID for each of the initial detections  
3. And then tracking each of the objects as they move around frames in a video, maintaining the assignment of unique IDs  
  
As descibed in first step, we should detect the from the each frame of video. Here *YOLO object detection* is used to detect the object in image/video frame. Implemention of yolo is in *ObjectTracker.py*. Next two steps are implemented in *CentroidTracking/centroidtracker.py*.  
  
To run on video file:  
  python ObjectTracker.py --input videos/car_chase_01.mp4 --confidence 0.5 --threshold 0.3  
To run on web-camera:  
  python ObjectTracker.py --input camera --confidence 0.5 --threshold 0.3
